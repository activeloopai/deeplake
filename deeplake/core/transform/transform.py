            ds_out (Dataset, optional): The dataset object to which the transform will get written. If this is not provided, data_in will be overwritten if it is a Deep Lake dataset, otherwise error will be raised.
                It should have all keys being generated in output already present as tensors. It's initial state should be either:-
                - Empty i.e. all tensors have no samples. In this case all samples are added to the dataset.
                - All tensors are populated and have same length. In this case new samples are appended to the dataset.
            num_workers (int): The number of workers to use for performing the transform. Defaults to 0. When set to 0, it will always use serial processing, irrespective of the scheduler.
            scheduler (str): The scheduler to be used to compute the transformation. Supported values include: 'serial', 'threaded', 'processed' and 'ray'.
                Defaults to 'threaded'.
            progressbar (bool): Displays a progress bar if True (default).
            skip_ok (bool): If True, skips the check for output tensors generated. This allows the user to skip certain tensors in the function definition.
                This is especially useful for inplace transformations in which certain tensors are not modified. Defaults to False.
            check_lengths (bool): If True, checks whether ds_out has tensors of same lengths initially.
            pad_data_in (bool): NOTE: This is only applicable if data_in is a Deep Lake dataset. If True, pads tensors of data_in to match the length of the largest tensor in data_in.
                Defaults to False.
            read_only_ok (bool): If ``True`` and output dataset is same as input dataset, the read-only check is skipped. This can be used to read data in parallel without making changes to underlying dataset.
                Defaults to False.
            cache_size (int): Cache size to be used by transform per worker.
            checkpoint_interval (int): If > 0, the transform will be checkpointed with a commit every ``checkpoint_interval`` input samples to avoid restarting full transform due to intermitten failures. If the transform is interrupted, the intermediate data is deleted and the dataset is reset to the last commit.
                If <= 0, no checkpointing is done. Checkpoint interval should be a multiple of num_workers if num_workers > 0. Defaults to 0.

    The ``eval`` method evaluates the pipeline/transform function.

    It has the following arguments:

    - ``data_in``: Input passed to the transform to generate output dataset.

        - It should support ``__getitem__`` and ``__len__``. This can be a Deep Lake dataset.

    - ``ds_out (Dataset, optional)``: The dataset object to which the transform will get written.

        - If this is not provided, data_in will be overwritten if it is a Deep Lake dataset, otherwise error will be raised.
        - It should have all keys being generated in output already present as tensors.
        - It's initial state should be either:

            - Empty i.e. all tensors have no samples. In this case all samples are added to the dataset.
            - All tensors are populated and have same length. In this case new samples are appended to the dataset.

    - ``num_workers (int)``: The number of workers to use for performing the transform.

        - Defaults to 0. When set to 0, it will always use serial processing, irrespective of the scheduler.

    - ``scheduler (str)``: The scheduler to be used to compute the transformation.

        - Supported values include: 'serial', 'threaded', 'processed' and 'ray'. Defaults to 'threaded'.

    - ``progressbar (bool)``: Displays a progress bar if True (default).

    - ``skip_ok (bool)``: If True, skips the check for output tensors generated.

        - This allows the user to skip certain tensors in the function definition.
        - This is especially useful for inplace transformations in which certain tensors are not modified. Defaults to ``False``.

    - ``ignore_errors (bool)``: If ``True``, input samples that causes transform to fail will be skipped and the errors will be ignored **if possible**.

    It raises the following errors:

    - ``InvalidInputDataError``: If data_in passed to transform is invalid. It should support ``__getitem__`` and ``__len__`` operations. Using scheduler other than "threaded" with deeplake dataset having base storage as memory as data_in will also raise this.

    - ``InvalidOutputDatasetError``: If all the tensors of ds_out passed to transform don't have the same length. Using scheduler other than "threaded" with deeplake dataset having base storage as memory as ds_out will also raise this.

    - ``TensorMismatchError``: If one or more of the outputs generated during transform contain different tensors than the ones present in 'ds_out' provided to transform.

    - ``UnsupportedSchedulerError``: If the scheduler passed is not recognized. Supported values include: 'serial', 'threaded', 'processed' and 'ray'.

    - ``TransformError``: All other exceptions raised if there are problems while running the pipeline.
