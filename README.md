## What is Deep Lake?

Deep Lake is a Database for AI powered by a storage format optimized for deep-learning applications. Deep Lake can be used for:

1. Storing data and vectors while building LLM applications
2. Managing datasets while training deep learning models
   
Deep Lake simplifies the deployment of enterprise-grade LLM-based products by offering storage for all data types (embeddings, audio, text, videos, images, pdfs, annotations, etc.), querying and vector search, data streaming while training models at scale, data versioning and lineage, and integrations with popular tools such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, Weights & Biases, and many more. Deep Lake works with data of any size, it is serverless, and it enables you to store all of your data in your own cloud and in one place. Deep Lake is used by Intel, Airbus, Matterport, ZERO Systems, Red Cross, Yale, & Oxford.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Comparisons to Familiar Tools

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs Chroma </b></summary>
  
Both Deep Lake & ChromaDB enable users to store and search vectors (embeddings) and offer integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex. However, they are architecturally very different. ChromaDB is a Vector Database that can be deployed locally or on a server using Docker and will offer a hosted solution shortly. Deep Lake is a serverless Vector Store deployed on the user‚Äôs own cloud, locally, or in-memory. All computations run client-side, which enables users to support lightweight production apps in seconds. Unlike ChromaDB, Deep Lake‚Äôs data format can store raw data such as images, videos, and text, in addition to embeddings. ChromaDB is limited to light metadata on top of the embeddings and has no visualization. Deep Lake datasets can be visualized and version controlled. Deep Lake also has a performant dataloader for fine-tuning your Large Language Models.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs Pinecone</b></summary>
  
Both Deep Lake and Pinecone enable users to store and search vectors (embeddings) and offer integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex. However, they are  architecturally very different. Pinecone is a fully-managed Vector Database that is optimized for highly demanding applications requiring a search for billions of vectors. Deep Lake is serverless. All computations run client-side, which enables users to get started in seconds. Unlike Pinecone, Deep Lake‚Äôs data format can store raw data such as images, videos, and text, in addition to embeddings. Deep Lake datasets can be visualized and version controlled. Pinecone is limited to light metadata on top of the embeddings and has no visualization. Deep Lake also has a performant dataloader for fine-tuning your Large Language Models.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs Weaviate</b></summary>
  
Both Deep Lake and Weaviate enable users to store and search vectors (embeddings) and offer integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex. However, they are  architecturally very different. Weaviate is a Vector Database that can be deployed in a managed service or by the user via Kubernetes or Docker. Deep Lake is serverless. All computations run client-side, which enables users to support lightweight production apps in seconds. Unlike Weaviate, Deep Lake‚Äôs data format can store raw data such as images, videos, and text, in addition to embeddings. Deep Lake datasets can be visualized and version controlled. Weaviate is limited to light metadata on top of the embeddings and has no visualization. Deep Lake also has a performant dataloader for fine-tuning your Large Language Models.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs DVC</b></summary>
  
Deep Lake and DVC offer dataset version control similar to git for data, but their methods for storing data differ significantly. Deep Lake converts and stores data as chunked compressed arrays, which enables rapid streaming to ML models, whereas DVC operates on top of data stored in less efficient traditional file structures. The Deep Lake format makes dataset versioning significantly easier compared to traditional file structures by DVC when datasets are composed of many files (i.e., many images). An additional distinction is that DVC primarily uses a command-line interface, whereas Deep Lake is a Python package. Lastly, Deep Lake offers an API to easily connect datasets to ML frameworks and other common ML tools and enables instant dataset visualization through [Activeloop's visualization tool](http://app.activeloop.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=readme).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs MosaicML MDS format </b></summary>
  
* **Data Storage Format:** Deep Lake operates on a columnar storage format, whereas MDS utilizes a row-wise storage approach. This fundamentally impacts how data is read, written, and organized in each system.
* **Compression:** Deep Lake offers a more flexible compression scheme, allowing control over both chunk-level and sample-level compression for each column or tensor. This feature eliminates the need for additional compressions like zstd, which would otherwise demand more CPU cycles for decompressing on top of formats like jpeg.
* **Shuffling:** MDS currently offers more advanced shuffling strategies.
* **Version Control & Visualization Support:** A notable feature of Deep Lake is its native version control and in-browser data visualization, a feature not present for MosaicML data format. This can provide significant advantages in managing, understanding, and tracking different versions of the data.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)</b></summary>
  
Deep Lake and TFDS seamlessly connect popular datasets to ML frameworks. Deep Lake datasets are compatible with both PyTorch and TensorFlow, whereas TFDS are only compatible with TensorFlow. A key difference between Deep Lake and TFDS is that Deep Lake datasets are designed for streaming from the cloud, whereas TFDS must be downloaded locally prior to use. As a result, with Deep Lake, one can import datasets directly from TensorFlow Datasets and stream them either to PyTorch or TensorFlow. In addition to providing access to popular publicly available datasets, Deep Lake also offers powerful tools for creating custom datasets, storing them on a variety of cloud storage providers, and collaborating with others via simple API. TFDS is primarily focused on giving the public easy access to commonly available datasets, and management of custom datasets is not the primary focus. A full comparison article can be found [here](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/tensor-flow-tf-data-activeloop-hub-how-to-implement-your-tensor-flow-data-pipelines-with-hub/).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs HuggingFace</b></summary>
Deep Lake and HuggingFace offer access to popular datasets, but Deep Lake primarily focuses on computer vision, whereas HuggingFace focuses on natural language processing. HuggingFace Transforms and other computational tools for NLP are not analogous to features offered by Deep Lake.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs WebDatasets</b></summary>
Deep Lake and WebDatasets both offer rapid data streaming across networks. They have nearly identical steaming speeds because the underlying network requests and data structures are very similar. However, Deep Lake offers superior random access and shuffling, its simple API is in python instead of command-line, and Deep Lake enables simple indexing and modification of the dataset without having to recreate it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deep Lake vs Zarr</b></summary>
Deep Lake and Zarr both offer storage of data as chunked arrays. However, Deep Lake is primarily designed for returning data as arrays using a simple API, rather than actually storing raw arrays (even though that's also possible). Deep Lake stores data in use-case-optimized formats, such as jpeg or png for images, or mp4 for video, and the user treats the data as if it's an array, because Deep Lake handles all the data processing in between. Deep Lake offers more flexibility for storing arrays with dynamic shape (ragged tensors), and it provides several features that are not naively available in Zarr such as version control, data streaming, and connecting data to ML Frameworks.
