Supabase CLI Reference

# CLI Reference

Bootstrap a Supabase project from a starter template



supabase bootstrap [template] [flags]

# CLI Reference

Initialize a local project


Initialize configurations for Supabase local development.

A `supabase/config.toml` file is created in your current working directory. This configuration is specific to each local project.

> You may override the directory path by specifying the `SUPABASE_WORKDIR` environment variable or `--workdir` flag.

In addition to `config.toml`, the `supabase` directory may also contain other Supabase objects, such as `migrations`, `functions`, `tests`, etc.


supabase init [flags]

# CLI Reference

Authenticate using an access token


Connect the Supabase CLI to your Supabase account by logging in with your [personal access token](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens).

Your access token is stored securely in [native credentials storage](https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring#dependencies). If native credentials storage is unavailable, it will be written to a plain text file at `~/.supabase/access-token`.

> If this behavior is not desired, such as in a CI environment, you may skip login by specifying the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in other commands.

The Supabase CLI uses the stored token to access Management APIs for projects, functions, secrets, etc.


supabase login [flags]

# CLI Reference

Link to a Supabase project


Link your local development project to a hosted Supabase project.

PostgREST configurations are fetched from the Supabase platform and validated against your local configuration file.

Optionally, database settings can be validated if you provide a password. Your database password is saved in native credentials storage if available.

> If you do not want to be prompted for the database password, such as in a CI environment, you may specify it explicitly via the `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` environment variable.

Some commands like `db dump`, `db push`, and `db pull` require your project to be linked first.


supabase link [flags]

# CLI Reference

Start containers for Supabase local development


Starts the Supabase local development stack.

Requires `supabase/config.toml` to be created in your current working directory by running `supabase init`.

All service containers are started by default. You can exclude those not needed by passing in `-x` flag. To exclude multiple containers, either pass in a comma separated string, such as `-x gotrue,imgproxy`, or specify `-x` flag multiple times.

> It is recommended to have at least 7GB of RAM to start all services.

Health checks are automatically added to verify the started containers. Use `--ignore-health-check` flag to ignore these errors.


supabase start [flags]

# CLI Reference

Stop all local Supabase containers


Stops the Supabase local development stack.

Requires `supabase/config.toml` to be created in your current working directory by running `supabase init`.

All Docker resources are maintained across restarts.  Use `--no-backup` flag to reset your local development data between restarts.

Use the `--all` flag to stop all local Supabase projects instances on the machine. Use with caution with `--no-backup` as it will delete all supabase local projects data.

supabase stop [flags]

# CLI Reference

Show status of local Supabase containers


Shows status of the Supabase local development stack.

Requires the local development stack to be started by running `supabase start` or `supabase db start`.

You can export the connection parameters for [initializing supabase-js](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/initializing) locally by specifying the `-o env` flag. Supported parameters include `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.


supabase status [flags]

# CLI Reference

Run tests on local Supabase containers





# CLI Reference

Tests local database with pgTAP


Executes pgTAP tests against the local database.

Requires the local development stack to be started by running `supabase start`.

Runs `pg_prove` in a container with unit test files volume mounted from `supabase/tests` directory. The test file can be suffixed by either `.sql` or `.pg` extension.

Since each test is wrapped in its own transaction, it will be individually rolled back regardless of success or failure.


supabase test db [path] ... [flags]

# CLI Reference

Create a new test file



supabase test new <name> [flags]

# CLI Reference

Run code generation tools


Automatically generates type definitions based on your Postgres database schema.

This command connects to your database (local or remote) and generates typed definitions that match your database tables, views, and stored procedures. By default, it generates TypeScript definitions, but also supports Go and Swift.

Generated types give you type safety and autocompletion when working with your database in code, helping prevent runtime errors and improving developer experience.

The types respect relationships, constraints, and custom types defined in your database schema.




# CLI Reference

Generate a JWT signing key

Securely generate a private JWT signing key for use in the CLI or to import in the dashboard.

Supported algorithms:
    ES256 - ECDSA with P-256 curve and SHA-256 (recommended)
    RS256 - RSA with SHA-256


supabase gen signing-key [flags]

# CLI Reference

Generate types from Postgres schema



supabase gen types [flags]

# CLI Reference

Manage Postgres databases





# CLI Reference

Pull schema from the remote database


Pulls schema changes from a remote database. A new migration file will be created under `supabase/migrations` directory.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running `supabase link`. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using `--db-url` flag.

> Note this command requires Docker Desktop (or a running Docker daemon), as it starts a local Postgres container to diff your remote schema.

Optionally, a new row can be inserted into the migration history table to reflect the current state of the remote database.

If no entries exist in the migration history table, `pg_dump` will be used to capture all contents of the remote schemas you have created. Otherwise, this command will only diff schema changes against the remote database, similar to running `db diff --linked`.


supabase db pull [migration name] [flags]

# CLI Reference

Push new migrations to the remote database


Pushes all local migrations to a remote database.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running `supabase link`. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using `--db-url` flag.

The first time this command is run, a migration history table will be created under `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`. After successfully applying a migration, a new row will be inserted into the migration history table with timestamp as its unique id. Subsequent pushes will skip migrations that have already been applied.

If you need to mutate the migration history table, such as deleting existing entries or inserting new entries without actually running the migration, use the `migration repair` command.

Use the `--dry-run` flag to view the list of changes before applying.


supabase db push [flags]

# CLI Reference

Resets the local database to current migrations


Resets the local database to a clean state.

Requires the local development stack to be started by running `supabase start`.

Recreates the local Postgres container and applies all local migrations found in `supabase/migrations` directory. If test data is defined in `supabase/seed.sql`, it will be seeded after the migrations are run. Any other data or schema changes made during local development will be discarded.

When running db reset with `--linked` or `--db-url` flag, a SQL script is executed to identify and drop all user created entities in the remote database. Since Postgres roles are cluster level entities, any custom roles created through the dashboard or `supabase/roles.sql` will not be deleted by remote reset.


supabase db reset [flags]

# CLI Reference

Dumps data or schemas from the remote database


Dumps contents from a remote database.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running `supabase link`. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using `--db-url` flag.

Runs `pg_dump` in a container with additional flags to exclude Supabase managed schemas. The ignored schemas include auth, storage, and those created by extensions.

The default dump does not contain any data or custom roles. To dump those contents explicitly, specify either the `--data-only` and `--role-only` flag.


supabase db dump [flags]

# CLI Reference

Diffs the local database for schema changes


Diffs schema changes made to the local or remote database.

Requires the local development stack to be running when diffing against the local database. To diff against a remote or self-hosted database, specify the `--linked` or `--db-url` flag respectively.

Runs [djrobstep/migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) in a container to compare schema differences between the target database and a shadow database. The shadow database is created by applying migrations in local `supabase/migrations` directory in a separate container. Output is written to stdout by default. For convenience, you can also save the schema diff as a new migration file by passing in `-f` flag.

By default, all schemas in the target database are diffed. Use the `--schema public,extensions` flag to restrict diffing to a subset of schemas.

While the diff command is able to capture most schema changes, there are cases where it is known to fail. Currently, this could happen if you schema contains:

- Changes to publication
- Changes to storage buckets
- Views with `security_invoker` attributes


supabase db diff [flags]

# CLI Reference

Checks local database for typing error


Lints local database for schema errors.

Requires the local development stack to be running when linting against the local database. To lint against a remote or self-hosted database, specify the `--linked` or `--db-url` flag respectively.

Runs `plpgsql_check` extension in the local Postgres container to check for errors in all schemas. The default lint level is `warning` and can be raised to error via the `--level` flag.

To lint against specific schemas only, pass in the `--schema` flag.

The `--fail-on` flag can be used to control when the command should exit with a non-zero status code. The possible values are:

- `none` (default): Always exit with a zero status code, regardless of lint results.
- `warning`: Exit with a non-zero status code if any warnings or errors are found.
- `error`: Exit with a non-zero status code only if errors are found.

This flag is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where you want to fail the build based on certain lint conditions.

supabase db start [flags]

# CLI Reference

Manage database migration scripts





# CLI Reference

Create an empty migration script


Creates a new migration file locally.

A `supabase/migrations` directory will be created if it does not already exist in your current `workdir`. All schema migration files must be created in this directory following the pattern `<timestamp>_<name>.sql`.

Outputs from other commands like `db diff` may be piped to `migration new <name>` via stdin.


supabase migration new <migration name>

# CLI Reference

List local and remote migrations


Lists migration history in both local and remote databases.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running `supabase link`. For self-hosted databases, you can pass in the connection parameters using `--db-url` flag.

> Note that URL strings must be escaped according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986).

Local migrations are stored in `supabase/migrations` directory while remote migrations are tracked in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` table. Only the timestamps are compared to identify any differences.

In case of discrepancies between the local and remote migration history, you can resolve them using the `migration repair` command.


supabase migration list [flags]

# CLI Reference

Fetch migration files from history table



supabase migration fetch [flags]

# CLI Reference

Repair the migration history table


Repairs the remote migration history table.

Requires your local project to be linked to a remote database by running `supabase link`.

If your local and remote migration history goes out of sync, you can repair the remote history by marking specific migrations as `--status applied` or `--status reverted`. Marking as `reverted` will delete an existing record from the migration history table while marking as `applied` will insert a new record.

For example, your migration history may look like the table below, with missing entries in either local or remote.

```bash
$ supabase migration list
        LOCAL      │     REMOTE     │     TIME (UTC)
  ─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────────
                   │ 20230103054303 │ 2023-01-03 05:43:03
   20230103054315  │                │ 2023-01-03 05:43:15
```

To reset your migration history to a clean state, first delete your local migration file.

```bash
$ rm supabase/migrations/20230103054315_remote_commit.sql

$ supabase migration list
        LOCAL      │     REMOTE     │     TIME (UTC)
  ─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────────
                   │ 20230103054303 │ 2023-01-03 05:43:03
```

Then mark the remote migration `20230103054303` as reverted.

```bash
$ supabase migration repair 20230103054303 --status reverted
Connecting to remote database...
Repaired migration history: [20220810154537] => reverted
Finished supabase migration repair.

$ supabase migration list
        LOCAL      │     REMOTE     │     TIME (UTC)
  ─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────────
```

Now you can run `db pull` again to dump the remote schema as a local migration file.

```bash
$ supabase db pull
Connecting to remote database...
Schema written to supabase/migrations/20240414044403_remote_schema.sql

# CLI Reference

Squash migrations to a single file


Squashes local schema migrations to a single migration file.

The squashed migration is equivalent to a schema only dump of the local database after applying existing migration files. This is especially useful when you want to remove repeated modifications of the same schema from your migration history.

However, one limitation is that data manipulation statements, such as insert, update, or delete, are omitted from the squashed migration. You will have to add them back manually in a new migration file. This includes cron jobs, storage buckets, and any encrypted secrets in vault.

By default, the latest `<timestamp>_<name>.sql` file will be updated to contain the squashed migration. You can override the target version using the `--version <timestamp>` flag.

If your `supabase/migrations` directory is empty, running `supabase squash` will do nothing.

Estimates space allocated to a relation that is full of dead tuples



This command displays an estimation of table "bloat" - Due to Postgres' [MVCC](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc.html) when data is updated or deleted new rows are created and old rows are made invisible and marked as "dead tuples". Usually the [autovaccum](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/database-size#vacuum-operations) process will asynchronously clean the dead tuples. Sometimes the autovaccum is unable to work fast enough to reduce or prevent tables from becoming bloated. High bloat can slow down queries, cause excessive IOPS and waste space in your database.

Tables with a high bloat ratio should be investigated to see if there are vacuuming is not quick enough or there are other issues.

```
    TYPE  │ SCHEMA NAME │        OBJECT NAME         │ BLOAT │ WASTE

# CLI Reference

Show queries that are holding locks and the queries that are waiting for them to be released



This command shows you statements that are currently holding locks and blocking, as well as the statement that is being blocked. This can be used in conjunction with `inspect db locks` to determine which statements need to be terminated in order to resolve lock contention.

```
    BLOCKED PID │ BLOCKING STATEMENT           │ BLOCKING DURATION │ BLOCKING PID │ BLOCKED STATEMENT                                                                      │ BLOCKED DURATION

# CLI Reference

Show queries from pg_stat_statements ordered by total times called



This command is much like the `supabase inspect db outliers` command, but ordered by the number of times a statement has been called.

You can use this information to see which queries are called most often, which can potentially be good candidates for optimisation.

```

Show queries which have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation



This command displays queries that have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation. Exclusive locks typically prevent other operations on that relation from taking place, and can be a cause of "hung" queries that are waiting for a lock to be granted.

If you see a query that is hanging for a very long time or causing blocking issues you may consider killing the query by connecting to the database and running `SELECT pg_cancel_backend(PID);` to cancel the query. If the query still does not stop you can force a hard stop by running `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(PID);`

```

supabase inspect db long-running-queries

# CLI Reference

Show queries from pg_stat_statements ordered by total execution time



This command displays statements, obtained from `pg_stat_statements`, ordered by the amount of time to execute in aggregate. This includes the statement itself, the total execution time for that statement, the proportion of total execution time for all statements that statement has taken up, the number of times that statement has been called, and the amount of time that statement spent on synchronous I/O (reading/writing from the file system).

Typically, an efficient query will have an appropriate ratio of calls to total execution time, with as little time spent on I/O as possible. Queries that have a high total execution time but low call count should be investigated to improve their performance. Queries that have a high proportion of execution time being spent on synchronous I/O should also be investigated.

```

# CLI Reference

Show information about replication slots on the database


This command shows information about [logical replication slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) that are setup on the database. It shows if the slot is active, the state of the WAL sender process ('startup', 'catchup', 'streaming', 'backup', 'stopping') the replication client address and the replication lag in GB.

This command is useful to check that the amount of replication lag is as low as possible, replication lag can occur due to network latency issues, slow disk I/O, long running transactions or lack of ability for the subscriber to consume WAL fast enough.


```

supabase inspect db table-stats

# CLI Reference

Show read/write activity ratio for tables based on block I/O operations



This command analyzes table I/O patterns to show read/write activity ratios based on block-level operations. It combines data from PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_user_tables` (for tuple operations) and `pg_statio_user_tables` (for block I/O) to categorize each table's workload profile.


The command classifies tables into categories:
- **Read-Heavy** - Read operations are more than 5x write operations (e.g., 1:10, 1:50)
- **Write-Heavy** - Write operations are more than 20% of read operations (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 2:1, 10:1)
- **Balanced** - Mixed workload where writes are between 20% and 500% of reads
- **Read-Only** - Only read operations detected
- **Write-Only** - Only write operations detected

```
SCHEMA │ TABLE        │ BLOCKS READ │ WRITE TUPLES │ BLOCKS WRITE │ ACTIVITY RATIO
───────┼──────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────
public │ user_events  │     450,234 │     9,004,680│       23,450 │ 20:1 (Write-Heavy)
public │ users        │      89,203 │        12,451│        1,203 │ 7.2:1 (Read-Heavy)
public │ sessions     │      15,402 │        14,823│        2,341 │ ≈1:1 (Balanced)
public │ cache_data   │     123,456 │             0│            0 │ Read-Only
auth   │ audit_logs   │           0 │        98,234│       12,341 │ Write-Only
```

**Note:** This command only displays tables that have had both read and write activity. Tables with no I/O operations are not shown. The classification ratio threshold (default: 5:1) determines when a table is considered "heavy" in one direction versus balanced.



supabase inspect db traffic-profile

# CLI Reference

Show statistics related to vacuum operations per table


This shows you stats about the vacuum activities for each table. Due to Postgres' [MVCC](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc.html) when data is updated or deleted new rows are created and old rows are made invisible and marked as "dead tuples". Usually the [autovaccum](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/database-size#vacuum-operations) process will aysnchronously clean the dead tuples.

The command lists when the last vacuum and last auto vacuum took place, the row count on the table as well as the count of dead rows and whether autovacuum is expected to run or not. If the number of dead rows is much higher than the row count, or if an autovacuum is expected but has not been performed for some time, this can indicate that autovacuum is not able to keep up and that your vacuum settings need to be tweaked or that you require more compute or disk IOPS to allow autovaccum to complete.

Manage Supabase Edge functions


Manage Supabase Edge Functions.

Supabase Edge Functions are server-less functions that run close to your users.

Edge Functions allow you to execute custom server-side code without deploying or scaling a traditional server. They're ideal for handling webhooks, custom API endpoints, data validation, and serving personalized content.

Edge Functions are written in TypeScript and run on Deno compatible edge runtime, which is a secure runtime with no package management needed, fast cold starts, and built-in security.




# CLI Reference

Create a new Function locally


Creates a new Edge Function with boilerplate code in the `supabase/functions` directory.

This command generates a starter TypeScript file with the necessary Deno imports and a basic function structure. The function is created as a new directory with the name you specify, containing an `index.ts` file with the function code.

After creating the function, you can edit it locally and then use `supabase functions serve`  to test it before deploying with `supabase functions deploy`.

# CLI Reference

Serve all Functions locally

`supabase functions serve` command includes additional flags to assist developers in debugging Edge Functions via the v8 inspector protocol, allowing for debugging via Chrome DevTools, VS Code, and IntelliJ IDEA for example. Refer to the [docs guide](/docs/guides/functions/debugging-tools) for setup instructions.

1. `--inspect`
   * Alias of `--inspect-mode brk`.

2. `--inspect-mode [ run | brk | wait ]`
   * Activates the inspector capability.
   * `run` mode simply allows a connection without additional behavior. It is not ideal for short scripts, but it can be useful for long-running scripts where you might occasionally want to set breakpoints.
   * `brk` mode same as `run` mode, but additionally sets a breakpoint at the first line to pause script execution before any code runs.
   * `wait` mode similar to `brk` mode, but instead of setting a breakpoint at the first line, it pauses script execution until an inspector session is connected.

3. `--inspect-main`
   * Can only be used when one of the above two flags is enabled.
   * By default, creating an inspector session for the main worker is not allowed, but this flag allows it.
   * Other behaviors follow the `inspect-mode` flag mentioned above.

Additionally, the following properties can be customized via `supabase/config.toml` under `edge_runtime` section.

1. `inspector_port`
   * The port used to listen to the Inspector session, defaults to 8083.
2. `policy`
   * A value that indicates how the edge-runtime should forward incoming HTTP requests to the worker.
   * `per_worker` allows multiple HTTP requests to be forwarded to a worker that has already been created.
   * `oneshot` will force the worker to process a single HTTP request and then exit. (Debugging purpose, This is especially useful if you want to reflect changes you've made immediately.)
