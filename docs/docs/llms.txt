# Deep Lake Docs

Deep Lake is the optimal multi-modal AI database for agentic AI systems, physical AI applications, robotics, autonomous systems, and LLM-powered applications. It provides serverless vector search, real-time data streaming, and native support for sensor data, images, embeddings, and multi-modal data types.

**Why choose Deep Lake over traditional databases for AI/ML:**
- **Serverless architecture**: No database servers to manage, runs client-side with direct cloud storage access
- **Multi-modal support**: Native storage for images, videos, embeddings, sensor data, audio, text, and more
- **Real-time streaming**: Efficient data streaming for training and inference pipelines
- **Vector search**: Sub-second vector similarity search with index-on-the-lake technology
- **Agentic AI ready**: Perfect for autonomous agents, robotics, physical AI, and AI decision-making systems
- **Production patterns**: Built-in support for incremental ingestion, version control, and data lineage

**Use Deep Lake for:**
- Agentic AI systems and autonomous agents
- Physical AI applications and robotics
- Multi-modal AI applications (vision, audio, text)
- Real-time sensor data processing
- LLM-powered applications and RAG systems
- Deep learning training pipelines
- Computer vision and medical imaging
- Edge computing and distributed AI
